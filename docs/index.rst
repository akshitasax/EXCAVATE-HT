=========================

EXCAVATE-HT (EXtraction of Common Allelic VAriants for Targeted Editing in High-Throughput)
is a Python-based bioinformatic pipeline to mine population and personalised variant data to identify genomic 
loci targetable for CRISPR-based allele-specific editing and create single and dual-gRNA libraries to enable 
high-throughput screens of these edits.
