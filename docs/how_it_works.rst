Introduction
============

Allele-specific targeting of CRISPR/Cas enzymes is a powerful tool that holds great potential to treat autosomal-dominant disease. 
By targeting commonly inherited variants present in large portions of the patient population, a small number of therapeutic gRNAs 
can be utilized to treat diseases. ExCAVaTE-HT (Extracting Common Allelic Variants for Targeting Editing in High-Throughput) is a 
tool to mine publicly available population variant data to generate CRISPR libraries of genomic loci targetable for allele-specific editing. 
ExCAVaTE allows users to define their loci of interest, Cas species, and SNP frequency, then outputs an annotated list of 
allele-specific gRNAs as well as a paired gRNA library.
